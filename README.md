# Huck

Huck is a small, cross-platform Ruby application to make sharing information
about hosts, applications, or anything else easy between machines on a network.

Huck's current intended functionality is:

* Generate some information about a host using something like
  [facter](https://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/facter) or
  [ohai](http://docs.opscode.com/ohai.html)
* Serialize and submit the information to a messaging queue
* Daemon process to read information from the queue and execute something for
  each received message

Extensibility is a major design goal in Huck. If you can generate some hash data
in ruby, you can make a new Huck data generator. If you can connect to a
different queueing service, you can make a new data sender/receiver, and if you
have a function that handles a string argument, you can make a new handler.

# Concepts

### Generators

These generate information on client machines to submit into a queue for a
server machine to read. Huck ships with receivers for Ohai and Facter, as well
as a few simple generators to read JSON or YAML files or collect hostname and
platform information.

### Senders

These run on clients and submit generated data into a queue. They use a generic
interface so that more messaging systems may be added on later. Currently only
[Amazon SQS](http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) is supported.

### Receivers

These poll messages out from a queue for processing, and also use a generic
interface to support more messaging systems. Currently only
[Amazon SQS](http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) is supported.

### Handlers

Handlers run on Huck servers and take action based on received messages. They
are arbitrary pieces of code which parse messages and then make other calls
using the data. Huck ships with two handlers: `echo` (for demo/debugging
purposes), and `exec`, which invokes an arbitrary script on the filesystem and
passes data in via stdin, and satisfies most use cases for Huck.

# Installing
```
$ gem install aws-sdk  # currently only sqs supported
$ gem install huck
```

**NOTE**
If you want to use Ohai or Facter, you should install those gems as well. Huck
does not depend on them to avoid installing both on every machine, and uses a
very basic host info generator by default.

# Using

This gem ships with a command-line interface to make things easy. You can run
them like this:

Start a server:
```
$ huck serve
```

Run the client once:
```
$ huck run
```

Take a look at the [config example](huck.conf.sample) to get an idea of how to
configure Huck for your environment.

If you don't want to put your config in `~/huck.conf` (the default), you may
pass the `-c` command-line option to both the client and server to specify a
different place.

## As a library

You may wish to use Huck as a library instead of using its CLI. While using Huck
as a library, it is possible to pass arbitrary code blocks to use as message
handlers. This looks something like:
```ruby
Huck.serve do |msg|
  puts msg
end
```

If you want to select a receiver or handler, you can do so.
```ruby
Huck.serve :receiver => 'sqs', :handler => 'echo'
```

The client can also be used from the library easily.
```ruby
Huck.run
```

You can select a specific sender or generator.
```ruby
Huck.run :sender => 'sqs', :generator => 'ohai'
```

Both `serve` and `run` will also accept a `:config` option to specify the
config path.

# Roadmap

* RabbitMQ support
* Support multiple handlers per message
